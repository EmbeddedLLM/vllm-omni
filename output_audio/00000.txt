vllm_text_output:
The first part of the audio recites "Mary had a little lamb". The image shows cherry blossoms with a tower in the background.The video might be considered funny because it's unexpected to see a baby reading a book while wearing glasses. It's not something you'd usually expect from a baby.What do you think about it? Do you have any other thoughts or questions?
